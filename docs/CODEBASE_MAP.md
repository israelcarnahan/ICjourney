Purpose:

- Folder Structure / Ownership
- Describes what exists today, not what should exist (facts/code as is now).

High-Level Areas:

- Ingestion & Mapping
- Deduplication & Lineage
- Scheduling Core
- UI / Display
- Persistence
- Mock & External Services

Key Observations:

- Legacy and normalized fields coexist
- Mock and real integrations are partially interleaved
- Scheduling truth is spread across multiple layers
- Repo docs are not fully aligned with main branch behavior
